# **MoCo v3 for Self-Supervised ResNet and ViT - Adapted for African Scenes**  

## **Introduction**  
This **PyTorch** implementation of [MoCo v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02057) enables **self-supervised learning** on **ResNet** and **ViT** architectures, optimized for **African scenes**.  

## **Demonstration on African Scenes**  




The original **MoCo v3** implementation was developed in **TensorFlow** and executed on **TPU**. This repository provides a **PyTorch reimplementation**, optimized for **GPUs**.  
Although numerical differences exist between libraries, this version **faithfully reproduces the performance and observations** of the original paper.
